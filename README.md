## Overview  
This project simulates a resilient, cloud-based telemetry platform for connected vehicles using **Azure Event Hubs with Geo-Disaster Recovery**. It ensures uninterrupted streaming of security-critical data‚Äîsuch as anomaly flags, diagnostic codes, and threat alerts‚Äîfrom in-vehicle systems to cloud analytics, even during regional outages.

## Objectives  
- Enable **real-time event ingestion** from automotive systems.  
- Ensure **high availability** and **automatic failover** using paired Event Hub namespaces.  
- Implement **checkpointing** and **telemetry monitoring** to track processing and recovery.  
- Simulate regional outages and evaluate **RTO** and **event loss**.

## Features  
- üöó **In-Vehicle Module Simulation**: Producers generate security events and send them to Azure Event Hubs.  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Geo-Disaster Recovery**: Alias-based namespace failover without consumer reconfiguration.  
- üì¶ **Checkpointing**: Azure Blob Storage integration for event consumption tracking.  
- üìä **Monitoring & Alerts**: Real-time dashboards with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.  
- üß™ **Failover Testing**: Automated tests validate system continuity during simulated outages.

## Tech Stack  
- **Azure Services**: Event Hubs, Blob Storage, Log Analytics, Monitor, Traffic Manager  
- **Language**: C# (.NET)  
- **Tools**: Visual Studio 2022, Azure CLI, ARM Templates  

## Use Case  
This project addresses disaster recovery in the **automotive cybersecurity** domain. It demonstrates how cloud-native tools can meet the high-availability and compliance needs (e.g., ISO/SAE 21434) of modern, connected vehicle systems.
